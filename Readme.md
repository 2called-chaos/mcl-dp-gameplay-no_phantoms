### No Phantoms

**Info:** This Datapack is part of [MCL](https://github.com/2called-chaos/mcl)

**Note:** This Datapack **CAN** be used standalone without MCL.

## Installation

  If you are using MCL you can find this datapack in your `!dp cookbook` or

  * Download to pool: `!dp fetch mcl://gameplay-no_phantoms`
  * Install to your current world: `!dp install mcl-gameplay-no_phantoms`

  If you don't use MCL just [download the zip](https://github.com/mclistener/mcl-dp-gameplay-no_phantoms/raw/master/releases/current.zip) and copy the zip file (or extracted folder) to your `<world>/datapacks` directory.


## Usage

  This datapack will automatically teleport all phantoms to y=-100 which will either cause them to despawn instantly or die very quickly (and the loot goes byebye).

  **Warning:** You will lose the ability to craft slow falling potions and repair elytras (mending still works ofc)
